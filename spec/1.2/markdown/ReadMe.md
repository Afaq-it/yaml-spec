YAML 1.2 spec in Markdown
=========================

This is the YAML 1.2 specification converted from the HTML at
https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html to Markdown.

The sources here can be used to build a new HTML page for this spec version.
See: https://spec.yaml.io/spec/1.2

The `2009/spec.html` file is a copy of the YAML 1.2 spec HTML (published at
https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/) that was used to originally make the `spec.md`
file.
