# YAML Community Resources

* [YAML GitHub Organization](https://github.com/yaml/)

  The YAML specification and and other core YAML projects can all be found on
  GitHub under the `yaml` organization.
  This is the place to get the source code, report or fix bugs, and discuss
  YAML topics publicly.

* [Matrix Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#chat:yaml.io)

  This is currently the most active space to engage with the YAML community in
  real time.
  Matrix provides a chat-room environment that feels very much like Slack.
  Matrix is Open Source, federated and end-to-end encrypted.

* IRC

  The `#yaml` channel on the libera.chat network is a long-running place where
  YAML developers hang out and field user queries from time to time.

* [Mailing List](https://sourceforge.net/projects/yaml/lists/yaml-core)

  YAML was originally designed by its creators over this mailing list.
  These days the mailing list is really only used for major announcements.
