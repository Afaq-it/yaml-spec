YAML Specification
==================

The YAML Data Language Specification

## Overview

[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a
_versioned_ language for data.
The current versions of the language are 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.

This repository is where the YAML language is further developed and the next
versions are defined.

This repository contains the source code and build system for the [published
YAML 1.2 specification](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).
Those files are under the `1.2` top level directory.

The various components of the next YAML specification version will be added
here incrementally following a well defined methodology.
